<h1>
<b>HTML5</b>
</h1>
<p>
HTML5 is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the <u>HTML standard</u>
</p>
<p>
It was published in October 2014 by the <i>World Wide Web Consortium</i> to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.
</p>
<p>
Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new video,audio and canvas elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as <b>main, section, article, header, footer, aside, nav and figure, are added.</b>

CSS3

<img src = "images/html&css.png"</img>
<img src = "images/html.jpg"</img>

<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.<i>CSS3</i> is the current advanced version.
</p>
<p>
Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, <b>CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules"</b>. Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility.
